# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

What should my first blog post be?

There are two common approaches you can take with your first blog post.

The first is to use your first post as an introduction to your blog and what you’re setting out to do.

The second is to jump right into your content as if you’ve been doing it for years.

There are pros and cons to each one, but my favorite is the second option because it gives you a better chance of writing something that will potentially get traffic over time, rather than something that gets buried on your site, never to be seen again.

For example, if you’re starting a food blog, and your first blog post is an “about me” style introduction to your blog and why you’re getting started, eventually that post will get buried underneath all the recipes you publish.

But if you just get right to the point and make your first blog post a recipe on something like chicken and rice casserole, that post can eventually get traffic for a long time, whether that’s from Google, Pinterest, etc.

Put it this way: your intro post won’t do much for your bottom line, but getting to the actual content can help you create something that can potentially stick around and get traffic and income.

When friends or family ask me what their first blog post should be, I tell them to act like they’ve been there before: save the intro for your about me page and get right down to business.
